			Welcome to my website! Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Tareq 
		Karimi, and I am currently an NPower Canada student. I studied Electrical 
		Engineering for one year at UOIT, but it took me a while to figure it wasn't my 
		passion. My passion is programming and computers! I love learning everything 
		about it. 
		
			Outside of class, I have a lot of hobbies. The sport teams I was a part of in
		in my school include: Baseball, Volleyball, Ultimate, and the Chess team. Chess is
		one of my many hobbies, and one in which I competed in highschool. My school won the 
		Toronto Division 2 chess league,going undefeated. I also happened to get the award for
		the Most Valuable Player.

			My github account, https://github.com/Plomboe, has the previous projects I have
		worked on. I created a calculator, a form application which you can check your weight
		on other planets, a number sorter and a few more. There are a lot of things I want to
		work on, but a couple I'm working on right now. What I'm working on right now is being 
		able to play sudoku on a form application. I saw a C# program for Pong, so I'm trying 
		to do that as well.
