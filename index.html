			Welcome to my website! Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Tareq 
		Karimi, and I'm a curious, eager philomath always trying to learn something new. 
		Whether it being history, math, physics, to computer science, programming and even 
		English, I'm always learning. and I am currently an NPower Canada student. I studied 
		Electrical Engineering for one year at UOIT, but it took me a while to figure it 
		wasn't my passion. My passion is programming and computers! 
		
			Outside of class, I have a lot of hobbies. The sport teams I was a part of in
		in my school include: Baseball, Volleyball, Ultimate, and the Chess team. Chess is
		one of my many hobbies, and one in which I competed in highschool. My school won the 
		Toronto Division 2 chess league,going undefeated. I also happened to get the award for
		the Most Valuable Player.

		Currently I'm trying to develop a text-based(console) interactive story game, with weapons,
		monsters and battles. I have my first test game I created up on Github.com/Plomboe, and 
		there will be more to come.
		
		My Github has the previous projects I have worked on. I created a calculator, a form 
		application which you can check your weight on other planets, a number sorter and a 
		few more. There are a lot of things I want to work on, but a couple I'm working on 
		right now. What I'm working on right now is being able to play sudoku on a form application.
